                <h3>Daily Check-ins and Mood Tracking</h3>
                <p>Students begin their day with a quick emotional check-in, which tracks their mood and mental state. Based on the results, the platform can recommend activities, such as mindfulness exercises, relaxation games, or even suggest taking a break.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Mindful Challenges and Rewards</h3>
                <p>Incorporate well-being challenges, such as “Take 10 minutes for mindfulness,” “Complete a gratitude journal entry,” or “Do a 5-minute stretch.” Completing these challenges earns students well-being badges and boosts their in-game score.</p>

                <h3>Virtual Counseling and Support</h3>
                <p>The platform could offer virtual counseling sessions, either through AI-driven chatbots that provide immediate support or by connecting students with real counselors. Additionally, there could be resources like articles, videos, or podcasts focused on mental health topics.</p>
